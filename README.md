- 👋 Hi, I’m @caw59 (use that, or call me 'Chris' - either's fine)
- 👀 I’m interested in web design and development, content strategies, copy-editing and creating and maintaining modern, fast websites that work well for their users.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about the jamstack and SSGs, particularly using Netlify and Hugo. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on design, coding and content - maybe helping you with my main expertise (writing good copy in perfect English) and getting help from you in yours, whatever that might be. Let me know! :)
- 📫 How to reach me: you can leave your contact details and say hi via 'Send feedback' here or in Discussions. Thanks! :)
